This case is very similar to the Outlets case. However, the flat plate is aligned with the horizontal. There is a file with no ambient velocity called plungingpimple. There's a file with ambient flow called plungingAmbient. 

snappy is the meshing file. simple is the steady state solver. plungingpimple is the dynamic mesh motion solver. plungingAmbient is the dynamic mesh motion solver with ambient flow.

To run the whole case, execute the Allrun script.

To clean, run the Allclean script.

To change the ambient velocity, make the change in both simple and plungingAmbient.

To modify the motion go to /xyzpimple/constant/dynamicMeshDict and change the spring parameters, initial velocity. Be careful not to give a motion which will deform the mesh too much. A badly deformed mesh will cause the solution to crash.

Some informative comments have been added to the texfiles.

An easy way to verify if the mesh motion is within acceptable limits is to go to /OutletsDyM , input the parameters to the dynamicMeshDict file and then run it. Remember to run it twice. This file runs only the mesh motion without considering the flow field. After running the file, open paraFoam and visually examine the motion. This will save a lot of time and frustration. This was adopted from Alejandro Roger Ull's work on dynamic meshes in OpenFOAM.
