A 2-D simulation of a flat plate in SHM. There is no pitching involved. Currently facing some segmentation faults and
other memory management issues. It is probably a programming error. Using a shell script to postprocess the forces by
execFlowFunctionObjects. The script is available here https://github.com/pruthvi1991/Shell-Scripts/blob/master/ForcesGrabber.sh
It just restarts the calculation from the crash point. Not an elegant solution but it works.
